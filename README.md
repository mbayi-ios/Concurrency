# Concurrency
Two pieces or more code running simultanously
- To be able to process code in paralle, the system groups units of codes in tasks.
- In swift Tasks can be implemented with asychronous and concurrent programming.
- Asynchronous in the programming pattern in which the code waits for a process to finish before completing the tasks.
- This allows the system to sahre computing resources among many processes.
- While waiting, the system can use the resources to perform other tasks.
- On the other hand, concurrent programming implements code that can take advantage of multiple core processors to execute tasks simultaneously
